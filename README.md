# edscrape

A python script to view every single unread post on ed.

## Dependencies

Requires python 3.8. 

Using `pythonnet` 3.0.0 should allow you to use a higher version of python (as per [this reply](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview/issues/868#issuecomment-1250769488)), but I got a similar bug to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70640459/python-pywebview-webview-start-system-nullreferenceexception-object-reference), which shockingly wasn't solved by the SO comment.  

## Installation

Install `poetry` from [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (although I would just use `pip`), then run `poetry install`

## Usage

Run `poetry run python main.py`
